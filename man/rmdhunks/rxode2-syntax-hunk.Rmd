An `rxode2` model specification consists of one or more 
statements optionally terminated by semi-colons `;` and
optional comments (comments are delimited by `#` and an 
end-of-line). 

A block of statements is a set of statements delimited by
curly braces, `{ ... }`.

Statements can be either assignments, conditional `if`/`else
if`/`else`, `while` loops (can be exited by `break`), special
statements, or printing statements (for debugging/testing)

Assignment statements can be:

- **simple** assignments, where the left hand is an identifier (i.e.,
  variable)
  
- special **time-derivative** assignments, where the left hand
  specifies the change of the amount in the corresponding state
  variable (compartment) with respect to time e.g., `d/dt(depot)`:
  
- special **initial-condition** assignments where the left hand
  specifies the compartment of the initial condition being specified,
  e.g. `depot(0) = 0`
  
- special model event changes including **bioavailability**
  (`f(depot)=1`), **lag time** (`alag(depot)=0`), **modeled rate**
  (`rate(depot)=2`) and **modeled duration** (`dur(depot)=2`). An
  example of these model features and the event specification for the
  modeled infusions the rxode2 data specification is found in [rxode2
  events vignette](https://nlmixr2.github.io/rxode2/articles/rxode2-event-types.html).
  
- special **change point syntax, or model times**.  These model times are
  specified by `mtime(var)=time`
  
- special **Jacobian-derivative** assignments, where the left hand
  specifies the change in the compartment ode with respect to a
  variable.  For example, if `d/dt(y) = dy`, then a Jacobian for this
  compartment can be specified as `df(y)/dy(dy) = 1`.  There may be
  some advantage to obtaining the solution or specifying the Jacobian
  for very stiff ODE systems.  However, for the few stiff systems we
  tried with LSODA, this actually slightly slowed down the solving.
  
Note that assignment can be done by `=`, `<-` or `~`.

When assigning with the `~` operator, the **simple
assignments** and **time-derivative** assignments will not be output.

Special statements can be:

- **Compartment declaration statements**, which can change the default
  dosing compartment and the assumed compartment number(s) as well as
  add extra compartment names at the end (useful for multiple-endpoint
  nlmixr models); These are specified by `cmt(compartmentName)`
  
- **Parameter declaration statements**, which can make sure the input
  parameters are in a certain order instead of ordering the parameters
  by the order they are parsed.  This is useful for keeping the
  parameter order the same when using 2 different ODE models.  These
  are specified by `param(par1, par2,...)`


An example model is shown below:

```
   # simple assignment
   C2 = centr/V2;

   # time-derivative assignment
   d/dt(centr) = F*KA*depot - CL*C2 - Q*C2 + Q*C3; 
```

Expressions in assignment and `if` statements can be numeric or logical.

Numeric expressions can include the following numeric operators `+, -,
*, /, ^` and those mathematical functions defined in the C or the R
math libraries (e.g., `fabs`, `exp`, `log`, `sin`, `abs`).

You may also access the R's functions in the [R math
libraries](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Numerical-analysis-subroutines),
like `lgammafn` for the log gamma function.

The `rxode2` syntax is case-sensitive, i.e., `ABC` is different 
than `abc`, `Abc`, `ABc`, etc.

### Identifiers

Like R, Identifiers (variable names) may consist of one or more alphanumeric,
underscore `_` or period `.` characters, but the first character
cannot be a digit or underscore `_`.

Identifiers in a model specification can refer to:

* State variables in the dynamic system (e.g., compartments in a
  pharmacokinetics model).
* Implied input variable, `t` (time), `tlast` (last time point), and 
  `podo` (oral dose, in the undocumented case of absorption transit 
   models).
* Special constants like `pi` or
  [R's predefined constants](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Mathematical-constants).
* Model parameters (e.g., `ka` rate of absorption, `CL` clearance, etc.)
* Others, as created by assignments as part of the model specification;
  these are referred as *LHS* (left-hand side) variable.

Currently, the `rxode2` modeling language only recognizes system state
variables and "parameters", thus, any values that need to be passed
from R to the ODE model (e.g., `age`) should be either passed in the
`params` argument of the integrator function `rxSolve()` or be in the
supplied event data-set.

There are certain variable names that are in the `rxode2` event tables.
To avoid confusion, the following event table-related items cannot be
assigned, or used as a state but can be accessed in the rxode2 code:

 - `cmt`
 - `dvid`
 - `addl`
 - `ss`
 - `rate`
 - `id`
 
However the following variables are cannot be used in a model specification:

 - `evid`
 - `ii`

Sometimes rxode2 generates variables that are fed back to rxode2.
Similarly, nlmixr generates some variables that are used in nlmixr
estimation and simulation.  These variables start with the either the
`rx` or `nlmixr` prefixes.  To avoid any problems, it is suggested to
not use these variables starting with either the `rx` or `nlmixr`
prefixes.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators support the standard R operators `==`, `!=` `>=`
`<=` `>` and `<`.  Like R these can be in `if()` or `while()`
statements, `ifelse()` expressions.  Additionally they can be in a
standard assignment.  For instance, the following is valid:

```
cov1 = covm*(sexf == "female") + covm*(sexf != "female")
```

Notice that you can also use character expressions in comparisons.
This convenience comes at a cost since character comparisons are
slower than numeric expressions.  Unlike R, `as.numeric` or
`as.integer` for these logical statements is not only not needed, but
will cause an syntax error if you try to use the function.
