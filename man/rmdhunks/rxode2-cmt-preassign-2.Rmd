You can also append "compartments" to the model.  Because of the ODE
solving internals, you cannot add fake compartments to the model until
after all the differential equations are defined.

For example this is legal:

```{r}
ode.1c.ka <- rxode2({
    C2 = center/V;
    d / dt(depot) = -KA * depot
    d/dt(center) = KA * depot - CL*C2
    cmt(eff);
})
print(ode.1c.ka)
```

But compartments defined before all the differential equations is not supported;  So the model below:

```
ode.1c.ka <- rxode2({
    cmt(eff);
    C2 = center/V;
    d / dt(depot) = -KA * depot
    d/dt(center) = KA * depot - CL*C2
})
```

will give an error:

```
Error in rxModelVars_(obj) : 
  Evaluation error: Compartment 'eff' needs differential equations defined.
```
