\arguments{
\item{model}{This is the ODE model specification.  It can be:
\itemize{
\item a string containing the set of ordinary differential
equations (ODE) and other expressions defining the changes in
the dynamic system.
\item a file name where the ODE system equation is contained
}

An ODE expression enclosed in \verb{\\\{\\\}}

(see also the \code{filename} argument). For
details, see the sections \dQuote{Details} and
\verb{rxode2 Syntax} below.}

\item{modName}{a string to be used as the model name. This string
is used for naming various aspects of the computations,
including generating C symbol names, dynamic libraries,
etc. Therefore, it is necessary that \code{modName} consists of
simple ASCII alphanumeric characters starting with a letter.}

\item{wd}{character string with a working directory where to
create a subdirectory according to \code{modName}. When
specified, a subdirectory named after the
\dQuote{\code{modName.d}} will be created and populated with a
C file, a dynamic loading library, plus various other working
files. If missing, the files are created (and removed) in the
temporary directory, and the rxode2 DLL for the model is
created in the current directory named \verb{rx_????_platform}, for
example \code{rx_129f8f97fb94a87ca49ca8dafe691e1e_i386.dll}}

\item{filename}{A file name or connection object where the
ODE-based model specification resides. Only one of \code{model}
or \code{filename} may be specified.}

\item{extraC}{Extra c code to include in the model.  This can be
useful to specify functions in the model.  These C functions
should usually take \code{double} precision arguments, and
return \code{double} precision values.}

\item{debug}{is a boolean indicating if the executable should be
compiled with verbose debugging information turned on.}

\item{calcJac}{boolean indicating if rxode2 will calculate the
Jacobain according to the specified ODEs.}

\item{calcSens}{boolean indicating if rxode2 will calculate the
sensitivities according to the specified ODEs.}

\item{collapseModel}{boolean indicating if rxode2 will remove all
LHS variables when calculating sensitivities.}

\item{package}{Package name for pre-compiled binaries.}

\item{...}{ignored arguments.}

\item{linCmtSens}{The method to calculate the linCmt() solutions}

\item{indLin}{Calculate inductive linearization matrices and
compile with inductive linearization support.}

\item{verbose}{When \code{TRUE} be verbose with the linear
compartmental model}

\item{fullPrint}{When using \code{printf} within the model, if \code{TRUE}
print on every step (except ME/indLin), otherwise when \code{FALSE}
print only when calculating the \code{d/dt}}
}
\value{
An object (environment) of class \code{rxode2} (see Chambers and Temple Lang (2001))
consisting of the following list of strings and functions:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{* `model` a character string holding the source model specification.
* `get.modelVars`a function that returns a list with 3 character
    vectors, `params`, `state`, and `lhs` of variable names used in the model
    specification. These will be output when the model is computed (i.e., the ODE solved by integration).

  * `solve`\{this function solves (integrates) the ODE. This
      is done by passing the code to [rxSolve()].
      This is as if you called `rxSolve(rxode2object, ...)`,
      but returns a matrix instead of a rxSolve object.

      `params`: a numeric named vector with values for every parameter
      in the ODE system; the names must correspond to the parameter
      identifiers used in the ODE specification;

      `events`: an `eventTable` object describing the
      input (e.g., doses) to the dynamic system and observation
      sampling time points (see  [eventTable()]);

      `inits`: a vector of initial values of the state variables
      (e.g., amounts in each compartment), and the order in this vector
      must be the same as the state variables (e.g., PK/PD compartments);


      `stiff`: a logical (`TRUE` by default) indicating whether
      the ODE system is stiff or not.

      For stiff ODE systems (`stiff = TRUE`), `rxode2` uses
      the LSODA (Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations)
      Fortran package, which implements an automatic method switching
      for stiff and non-stiff problems along the integration interval,
      authored by Hindmarsh and Petzold (2003).

      For non-stiff systems (`stiff = FALSE`), `rxode2` uses `DOP853`,
      an explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8(5, 3) of Dormand and Prince
      as implemented in C by Hairer and Wanner (1993).

      `trans_abs`: a logical (`FALSE` by default) indicating
      whether to fit a transit absorption term
      (TODO: need further documentation and example);

      `atol`: a numeric absolute tolerance (1e-08 by default);

      `rtol`: a numeric relative tolerance (1e-06 by default).e

      The output of \\dQuote\{solve\} is a matrix with as many rows as there
      are sampled time points and as many columns as system variables
      (as defined by the ODEs and additional assignments in the rxode2 model
          code).\}

  * `isValid` a function that (naively) checks for model validity,
      namely that the C object code reflects the latest model
      specification.
  * `version` a string with the version of the `rxode2`
      object (not the package).
  * `dynLoad` a function with one `force = FALSE` argument
      that dynamically loads the object code if needed.
  * `dynUnload` a function with no argument that unloads
      the model object code.
  * `delete` removes all created model files, including C and DLL files.
      The model object is no longer valid and should be removed, e.g.,
      `rm(m1)`.
  * `run` deprecated, use `solve`.
  * `get.index` deprecated.
  * `getObj` internal (not user callable) function.

\description{
Create a dynamic ODE-based model object suitably for translation
into fast C code
}
\details{
The \code{Rx} in the name \code{rxode2} is meant to suggest the
abbreviation \emph{Rx} for a medical prescription, and thus to
suggest the package emphasis on pharmacometrics modeling, including
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), disease progression,
drug-disease modeling, etc.

The ODE-based model specification may be coded inside a character
string or in a text file, see Section \emph{rxode2 Syntax} below for
coding details.  An internal \code{rxode2} compilation manager
object translates the ODE system into C, compiles it, and
dynamically loads the object code into the current R session.  The
call to \code{rxode2} produces an object of class \code{rxode2} which
consists of a list-like structure (environment) with various member
functions (see Section \emph{Value} below).

For evaluating \code{rxode2} models, two types of inputs may be
provided: a required set of time points for querying the state of
the ODE system and an optional set of doses (input amounts).  These
inputs are combined into a single \emph{event table} object created
with the function \code{\link[=eventTable]{eventTable()}} or \code{\link[=et]{et()}}.

An \code{rxode2} model specification consists of one or more statements
optionally terminated by semi-colons \verb{;} and optional comments (comments
are delimited by \verb{#} and an end-of-line).

A block of statements is a set of statements delimited by curly braces,
\code{{ ... }}.

Statements can be either assignments, conditional \code{if}/\verb{else if}/\verb{else},
\code{while} loops (can be exited by \code{break}), special statements, or
printing statements (for debugging/testing)

Assignment statements can be:
\itemize{
\item \strong{simple} assignments, where the left hand is an identifier (i.e.,
variable)
\item special \strong{time-derivative} assignments, where the left hand specifies
the change of the amount in the corresponding state variable
(compartment) with respect to time e.g., \code{d/dt(depot)}:
\item special \strong{initial-condition} assignments where the left hand
specifies the compartment of the initial condition being specified,
e.g.Â \code{depot(0) = 0}
\item special model event changes including \strong{bioavailability}
(\code{f(depot)=1}), \strong{lag time} (\code{alag(depot)=0}), \strong{modeled rate}
(\code{rate(depot)=2}) and \strong{modeled duration} (\code{dur(depot)=2}). An
example of these model features and the event specification for the
modeled infusions the rxode2 data specification is found in \href{https://nlmixr2.github.io/rxode2/articles/rxode2-event-types.html}{rxode2 events vignette}.
\item special \strong{change point syntax, or model times}. These model times are
specified by \code{mtime(var)=time}
\item special \strong{Jacobian-derivative} assignments, where the left hand
specifies the change in the compartment ode with respect to a
variable. For example, if \code{d/dt(y) = dy}, then a Jacobian for this
compartment can be specified as \code{df(y)/dy(dy) = 1}. There may be some
advantage to obtaining the solution or specifying the Jacobian for
very stiff ODE systems. However, for the few stiff systems we tried
with LSODA, this actually slightly slowed down the solving.
}

Note that assignment can be done by \code{=}, \verb{<-} or \code{~}.

When assigning with the \code{~} operator, the \strong{simple assignments} and
\strong{time-derivative} assignments will not be output.

Special statements can be:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Compartment declaration statements}, which can change the default
dosing compartment and the assumed compartment number(s) as well as
add extra compartment names at the end (useful for multiple-endpoint
nlmixr models); These are specified by \code{cmt(compartmentName)}
\item \strong{Parameter declaration statements}, which can make sure the input
parameters are in a certain order instead of ordering the parameters
by the order they are parsed. This is useful for keeping the parameter
order the same when using 2 different ODE models. These are specified
by \code{param(par1, par2,...)}
}

An example model is shown below:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{   # simple assignment
   C2 = centr/V2;

   # time-derivative assignment
   d/dt(centr) = F*KA*depot - CL*C2 - Q*C2 + Q*C3; 
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Expressions in assignment and \code{if} statements can be numeric or logical.

Numeric expressions can include the following numeric operators
\verb{+, -, *, /, ^} and those mathematical functions defined in the C or the
R math libraries (e.g., \code{fabs}, \code{exp}, \code{log}, \code{sin}, \code{abs}).

You may also access the Râs functions in the \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Numerical-analysis-subroutines}{R math libraries},
like \code{lgammafn} for the log gamma function.

The \code{rxode2} syntax is case-sensitive, i.e., \code{ABC} is different than
\code{abc}, \code{Abc}, \code{ABc}, etc.
\subsection{Identifiers}{

Like R, Identifiers (variable names) may consist of one or more
alphanumeric, underscore \verb{_} or period \code{.} characters, but the first
character cannot be a digit or underscore \verb{_}.

Identifiers in a model specification can refer to:
\itemize{
\item State variables in the dynamic system (e.g., compartments in a
pharmacokinetics model).
\item Implied input variable, \code{t} (time), \code{tlast} (last time point), and
\code{podo} (oral dose, in the undocumented case of absorption transit
models).
\item Special constants like \code{pi} or \href{https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Mathematical-constants}{Râs predefined constants}.
\item Model parameters (e.g., \code{ka} rate of absorption, \code{CL} clearance, etc.)
\item Others, as created by assignments as part of the model specification;
these are referred as \emph{LHS} (left-hand side) variable.
}

Currently, the \code{rxode2} modeling language only recognizes system state
variables and âparametersâ, thus, any values that need to be passed from
R to the ODE model (e.g., \code{age}) should be either passed in the \code{params}
argument of the integrator function \code{rxSolve()} or be in the supplied
event data-set.

There are certain variable names that are in the \code{rxode2} event tables.
To avoid confusion, the following event table-related items cannot be
assigned, or used as a state but can be accessed in the rxode2 code:
\itemize{
\item \code{cmt}
\item \code{dvid}
\item \code{addl}
\item \code{ss}
\item \code{rate}
\item \code{id}
}

However the following variables are cannot be used in a model
specification:
\itemize{
\item \code{evid}
\item \code{ii}
}

Sometimes rxode2 generates variables that are fed back to rxode2.
Similarly, nlmixr generates some variables that are used in nlmixr
estimation and simulation. These variables start with the either the
\code{rx} or \code{nlmixr} prefixes. To avoid any problems, it is suggested to not
use these variables starting with either the \code{rx} or \code{nlmixr} prefixes.
}

\subsection{Logical Operators}{

Logical operators support the standard R operators \code{==}, \code{!=} \code{>=} \code{<=}
\code{>} and \code{<}. Like R these can be in \verb{if()} or \verb{while()} statements,
\code{ifelse()} expressions. Additionally they can be in a standard
assignment. For instance, the following is valid:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{cov1 = covm*(sexf == "female") + covm*(sexf != "female")
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

Notice that you can also use character expressions in comparisons. This
convenience comes at a cost since character comparisons are slower than
numeric expressions. Unlike R, \code{as.numeric} or \code{as.integer} for these
logical statements is not only not needed, but will cause an syntax
error if you try to use the function.
